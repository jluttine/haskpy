# Some thoughts on design: One could implement all the methods (except match)
# in Maybe class by using the match method to choose the implementation. But
# this would be just clumsy and add overhead. Class inheritance is a Pythonic
# way of choosing the correct method implementation. Also, Just needs to
# support equality testing, so that's also easy to achieve by making it a
# class.
